# No support for RHEL, and/or its upstreams and/or downstreams

Since [IBM acquired Red Hat back in 2020](https://www.redhat.com/en/ibm), the principle behind Red Hat's business model has changed from [fully free and open-source](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/open-source),
to [threatening source code availability and vaccuming your wallet](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream) as IBM did over the last 80 years.

First, [they screwed over CentOS](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/on-the-death-of-centos-red-hat-liaison-brian-exelbierd-speaks/), a Red Hat-supported RHEL derivative. 
(And no, [CentOS Stream is NOT a replacement!](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/centos-shifts-from-red-hat-unbranded-to-red-hat-beta/))

Then, [they screwed over all other RHEL derivatives with the closure of their source code to the general public](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/furthering-evolution-centos-stream).
This forced RHEL downstream developers to essentially fix bugs with a clean-room environment. (Not a great idea, imo.)

Because of said IBM puppeteering, I cannot rely on RHEL, and/or its upstreams and/or downstreams.
Therefore, I am not going to pursue support for these platforms, and I will discourage use of said platforms.

This means that if your issue concerns systems like Rocky, Alma, or even Fedora, I will not provide support, nor fix issues concerning that system.
I will provide support for Debian-based distributions ONLY.

IMO, users should boycott RHEL and Fedora. Maybe that will force Big Blue Hat to backpedal on their choices. #BoycottRHEL
