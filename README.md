- 👋 Hi, I’m @alipex
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux usage
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux usage and programming in various languages
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing currently
- 📫 How to reach me: use issues or PR's

**EDIT March 7th 2022: Current situation regarding the 2022 Russo-Ukranian war: I do not support Ukraine nor Russia.**
- Russia invaded a sovereign state, unlawfully, while occuping Ukraine's territories.
- However, Ukraine has killed thousands upon thousands of innocent people, which are not ethnically Ukranian, on their and other territories, due to them being oversensitive nationalists - and this is (unfortunately) happening from the 1920's. 
- **All software under my ownership will be strictly neutral. Any pull requests to add anything to support either side will be denied with a passion.**
