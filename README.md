- 📫 How to reach me ...

**EDIT March 7th 2022: Becuase of the current situation in the world, I do not support Ukraine nor Russia.**
- Russia invaded a sovereign state, unlawfully, while occuping Ukraine's territories.
- However, Ukraine has killed thousands upon thousands of innocent people, which are not ethnically Ukranian, on their and other territories, due to them being oversensitive nationalists - and this is (unfortunately) happening from the 1920's. 
- **All software under my ownership will be strictly neutral. Any pull requests to add slogans to support either side will be denied with a passion.**
